We've created a basic implementation of the game's ui. For some reason it doesn't work via terminal so we'd like you to run it using intellij's run button. The code does compile through maven though, so that's not a problem. We're getting 'no main manifest attribute' in jar file.


Our UML diagram is attached and you can see it by running the StickHero class in intellij. 

All method declarations are in the java files, and we've made all the classes we could think of so far. I hope that we still can add more methods as we see fit while actually making the game. I'm not sure if this abides with what we were supposed to do, but I believe that we've done everything that was asked for, maybe in some different way. So please consider this.
